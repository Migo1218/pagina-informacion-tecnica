            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
                on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript
                has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based
                model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                JavaScript
                also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

            <code>function saludame(nombre){
                    alert("hola" + nombre)}
                    saludame("Miguel")
                </code>
            <code>function (){};
                    const f = 5;
                    //This will cause an error also
                    const g = 5;
                    var g;
                    //statements
                </code>

            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
                escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="scope">
            <header>scope</header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within
                a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
                following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is
                declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <code>
            function myFunction(p1, p2) {
                return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
              }
        </code>

        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Funciones">
            <header>Funciones</header>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says
                to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally
                or in the calling function.</p>
            <code>function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
            return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
          }
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius(77);</code>
            <code>function saludame(nombre){
            alert("hola" + nombre)}
            saludame("Miguel")</code>
